    <p>
      Hello! I’m <strong>Bhavya</strong>, a passionate and creative artist who believes that art is the purest form of self-expression.🌟
      My journey began with simple school assignments and project work, where I first discovered my love for drawing and visual creativity.
    </p>

    <p>
      What started as a hobby slowly turned into a deep interest, motivating me to explore different styles, techniques, and ideas.
      Every artwork I create reflects emotions, thoughts, and stories inspired by everyday life.🎨
    </p>

    <p>
      Along with art, I am also a <strong>Computer Science Engineering (CSE) student</strong>.💻
      This website, <em>*Purity of Art*</em>, is completely designed and developed by me as a way to combine my technical skills with my artistic passion.⚙️
    </p>

    <p>
      Through this platform, I aim to share my artwork, connect with fellow art lovers, and continue learning and growing as both an artist and a developer.🫂
      Thank you for being a part of my journey!😊
